&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tupac Shakur was a successful hip-hop artist hailing from New York City, although most commonly affiliated with the West Coast. On September 7th, 1996 at 11:15PM the car that Tupac was in stopped at a red light (East Flamingo Road and Koval Lane). A white Cadillac pulled up on their right side and rapidly fired gunshots through their open window at Shakur. Tupac was hit 4 times. He was hit twice in the chest, once in the thigh, and once in the arm. One of the shots to his chest hit him in the right lung.

This was just a short little overview of the death of Tupac Shakur. I needed to touch up my HTML skills so I figured I might as well make an article about something that I was interested in myself.
